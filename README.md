# PCRNN
 Partly Connected Reflection Neural Network
 
 Some neurons in this neural network serve as reflection neurons
 
 Reflection Neuron Number = pc_ratio (Partly Connected Ratio) * Layer Neuron Number

 When pc_ratio = 1 / 8, 
 
 if L1 = 5, L2 = 2, L3 = 1,
 
 Fully Connected Neural Network connection = 12

 Partly Connected Reflection Neural Network connection = 10
